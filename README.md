# KerbalDev for Rider

Rider plugin for Kerbal Space Program 2 mod development.

Currently adds a project template for SpaceWarp mods, based on [munix's SpaceWarp .NET template](https://github.com/jan-bures/SpaceWarp.Template)
(this needs a plugin as Rider currently does not support custom project template parameters).
